At first, I was hesitant to work in groups because I often work alone at work. 
But after introducing myself and being known to everyone, I started to get more used to talking to people.
My team is amazing because everyone can come up with so many great ideas and solutions to problems. 
What I find difficult is that when everyone has their own ideas and it is difficult to refuse to include those ideas in the project.
I guess they will feel a bit disappointed when I say that the idea is not suitable. suitable for the project... 
But anyway, I also learned a lot when working in groups, how to communicate effectively,
how to convey ideas into words and how to say "no" to inappropriate ideas. .

Here is our Project
